# Eliza
The Eliza program is a simple chatbot that simulates human-like conversation. It uses pattern matching and substitution to generate responses based on user input. The program is written in Python and makes use of external JSON files to store its psychobabble and reflections. The main interface for the user to interact with ELIZA is provided by the chat method, which enters a loop to prompt the user for input and returns a response generated by the respond method. The program demonstrates the basic principles of chatbot design, making it a great starting point for those interested in creating their own chatbots.
